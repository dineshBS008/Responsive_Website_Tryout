                Education is a purposeful activity directed at achieving certain aims, such as transmitting knowledge or
                fostering skills and character traits. These aims may include the development of understanding,
                rationality, kindness, and honesty. Various researchers emphasize the role of critical thinking in order
                to distinguish education from indoctrination. Some theorists require that education results in an
                improvement of the student while others prefer a value-neutral definition of the term. In a slightly
                different sense, education may also refer, not to the process, but to the product of this process: the
                mental states and dispositions possessed by educated people.

            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">
                The educational system in Nepal was long based on home-schooling and gurukulas.This was similar to
                the former Indian system of education, in which the pupils would learn either in their homes or with
                reputed priests or Gurus. Before Nepal was declared a democratic country, the general public had no
                access to formal education. The first formal school, Durbar High School, established by Jung Bahadur
                Rana in 1853, was intended for the elite. The birth of Nepalese democracy in 1951 opened its classrooms
                to a more diverse population.

                Regardless of setting, educational methods include teaching, training, storytelling, discussion, and
                directed research. The methodology of teaching is called pedagogy. Education is supported by a variety
                of different philosophies, theories and empirical research agendas.

                There are movements for education reforms, such as for improving quality and efficiency of education
                towards relevance in students' lives and efficient problem solving in modern or future society at large,
                or for evidence-based education methodologies. A right to education has been recognized by some
                governments and the United Nations.
